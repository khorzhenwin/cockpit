# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cockpit project is an AI-powered life advisory system built with Next.js that integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to serve as an intelligent life partner. The system ingests comprehensive personal data across multiple life domains (finances, career, health, emotions, relationships, etc.) and provides proactive insights, advice, and recommendations. Rather than being a collection of management tools, Cockpit acts as a knowledgeable advisor that understands your complete life context and can guide decision-making across all areas.
